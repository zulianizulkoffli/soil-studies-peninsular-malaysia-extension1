# Soil_Studies_Peninsular_Malaysia represents Data Visualization for Soil Classification in Peninsular Malaysia

This project aims to provide an interactive data visualization tool for soil classification across various locations in Peninsular Malaysia. The tool uses Streamlit to create an easy-to-use interface for exploring soil types, properties, and their suitability for agricultural and development purposes.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script for the Streamlit app.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the Streamlit app.
- `Data_For_Viz.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used in the application.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Soil-Classification-App.git
    cd Soil-Classification-App
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the App

1. Ensure that the `Data_For_Viz.csv` file is in the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8501`.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: View soil classifications across different locations in Peninsular Malaysia.
- **Detailed Information**: Explore detailed soil parameters and descriptions for each location.
- **Research Findings**: Read research findings related to soil types and their suitability for agriculture and development.

## Research Disclaimer

The findings presented in this application are based on the thesis "Correlations of Geo-Electrical Resistivity with Geotechnical Soil Parameters" by Muhammad Noor Hisyam Bin Jusoh. The information shown here pertains to the findings for 0.5m depth soil from the surface. The thesis study extends to a depth of 3m. For further information on data and complexity, you may reach the thesis author (researcher).
